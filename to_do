base the smash (distance matrix) wrapper on the classification wrapper now
i.e. create a class that stores the path to the binary and then

attributes are X (the np.ndarray, and a function quantizer) assume quantizer is Q so then you would assume new_x =Q(x)
default behavior is to

if the user feeds in X with floats and no Q is specified, then raise an Error

for clustering class, choose a sklearn clustering distance

don't worry about I/O for any of these wrappers

ask Ishanu later when we do consider a fix to the temporary directory thing

DATA_ZED on git repo for dataset

if you have any issues ask Ishanu
